# 🚀 Getting Started with Docker

## 🌟 Overview
This is a simple project designed to demonstrate containerization using Docker. It includes a Python script (`hello.py`) that prints "hello" to the console when executed inside a Docker container. This setup allows for easy deployment and environment consistency across different systems.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
```bash
📂
│── 📜 Dockerfile           # Defines the Docker image and installation steps
│── 🐍 hello.py             # Simple Python script that prints "hello"
│── 📖 README.md            # Project documentation
```

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:
- 🐳 Docker

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2️⃣ Build the Docker Image
Docker will create an image based on the `Dockerfile`, which contains the necessary instructions to set up the environment and copy `hello.py`.
```bash
docker build -t hello .
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Docker Container
After building the image, you can run a container that will execute `hello.py`.
```bash
docker run hello
```

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
- The `Dockerfile` is based on a lightweight Python image (`python:3-slim`).
- It sets environment variables to optimize Python execution.
- It copies `hello.py` into the container.
- When the container starts, it runs `python hello.py`, printing "hello" to the console.

## 🔄 Stopping & Cleaning Up
### Checking Running Containers
To view active Docker containers:
```bash
docker ps
```
To stop a running container:
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

### Removing Unused Docker Images
If needed, clean up unnecessary images:
```bash
docker image prune -a
```

## 📜 Dockerfile
Below is the content of the `Dockerfile` used in this project:
```Dockerfile
# For more information, please refer to https://aka.ms/vscode-docker-python
FROM python:3-slim

# Keeps Python from generating .pyc files in the container
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

# Turns off buffering for easier container logging
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

WORKDIR .
COPY hello.py .

# During debugging, this entry point will be overridden. 
# For more information, please refer to https://aka.ms/vscode-docker-python-debug
CMD ["python", "hello.py"]
```
