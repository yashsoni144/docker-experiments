# 🚢 Titanic Survival Predictor: A Containerized Streamlit ML App

## 📌 Overview
The **Titanic Survival Prediction Model** is a machine learning application that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on various input features. 

This project is built using **Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface. To ensure seamless deployment and portability, **Docker** is used to containerize the application.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model (titanic_model.py)
The model is trained using a **Random Forest Classifier** from scikit-learn, based on Titanic dataset features. The trained model is saved as **titanic_model.pkl** using joblib, ensuring efficient storage and easy loading in the web application.

### 🔍 Steps in `titanic_model.py`
1. Load and preprocess the **Titanic dataset**.
2. Handle missing values and **encode categorical data**.
3. Train the **Random Forest Model**.
4. Save the trained model as `titanic_model.pkl` for future predictions.

## 🎨 Interactive Streamlit Application (main.py)
The **Streamlit app** provides a clean and interactive interface for users to input passenger details and predict survival chances.

### ✨ Features:
✔️ **User-friendly UI** with enhanced CSS.  
✔️ **Real-time prediction updates** using the trained model.  
✔️ **Interactive sliders, dropdowns, and form elements** for user input.

## 🐳 Docker Setup (Containerization)
To ensure easy deployment across different environments, the application is **containerized using Docker**.

### 📄 Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Use a minimal Python base image
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy necessary files
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
COPY main.py main.py
COPY titanic_model.pkl titanic_model.pkl

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the Streamlit application port
EXPOSE 8501

# Run the Streamlit application
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "main.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```
